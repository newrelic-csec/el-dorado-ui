# El Dorado UI

This is a Sinatra app that provides a UI and canned queries for El Dorado, an enterprise structure warehouse.
The web user can retreive results from a menu of queries or author new ad-hoc queries interactively.
Results are in the form of tables or diagrams both of which can hyperlink to related queries.

Queries are written in Neo4j's Cypher language. Tabular results are then optionally rendered by template expansion into Graphviz's Dot language and displayed as SVG. Modeling conventions support tracing relations to their ETL source, but the graph database is not otherwise restricted.

## Running Locally

To get this app running locally:

~~~
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec rackup
~~~

You can then visit the app at http://localhost:9292

We assume the `dot` command is available from [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).

> `brew install graphviz`

If you are not running your own instance of Neo4J locally, you'll need to alter
the database connection string with the GRAPHDBURL environment variable.

~~~
GRAPHDBURL='http://neo4j:neo4j@example.com:7474/' bundler exec rackup -o '0.0.0.0'
~~~
